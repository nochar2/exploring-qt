THE PARSER IS OUTDATED, FIND / FIX THE C VERSION AND USE THAT ONE


option to say "jump to next / previous note" instead of fixating on snap
redrawing everything in a model has its issues, store at least expanded/collapsed state?
	and scroll pos? like it's not a good idea anyway but unsynced state is worse
a way to have Difficulty tabs
	if there are no diffs selected or created yet, what should the view look like?


the note edit widget should have green outline when it's selected so one knows when
	they can put notes to it; although, maybe you want the keys to work globally
	unless an edit field is selected...

float locale-specific comma in QDoubleSpinBoxes

scroll position always scrolls to the beginning

changing gametype should reflow the game so that i can use more columns (SoA?)

draw / handle different note types
- I should be able to switch to whichever type I currently have
- I should be able to place the type (holds should extend to infinity maybe with some warning)
- holds look like a freaking nightmare
- draw mines somehow at least


precompiled.h probably shouldn't exist ???

text has dumb but

status_bar->redraw and preview_actual->update are getting stale, centralize this somehow
