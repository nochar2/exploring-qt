full compilation is now close to 12 seconds
- precompiled headers / including .cpp (forgot) bring it only to 9.5s
- I have already spent time optimizing the STL headers
	- replacing <array> and <chrono>: 11.6 s -> 11.3 s
		- still need to implement this on windows too then
	- replacing <fstream>: idk the times are inconsistent, still 11-11.5 s

	- replacing the stdlib headers actually gains you nothing in the Qt
	compilation unit; g++ -E gives you the same 150k lines.
	- <QtWidgets> is 300k lines
	
- zerokara.moc is 100k lines of code
	- GONE. Now it's still around 10.7 s


- clangd is completely gone it seems, not sure if by my fault
	- somehow fixed?
